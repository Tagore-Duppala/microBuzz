# microBuzz - Micro Blogging Application (Spring Boot)

MicroBuzz is a microblogging application that allows users to share their thoughts and interact in real-time. Built using a microservice architecture with four distinct microservices, including a Registry service powered by Eureka for efficient service discovery, management and API Gateway to handle all client requests and route them to the appropriate service, it ensures seamless and scalable performance for user engagement.
